# Ventilator-Pressure-Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict the pressure in the ventilator
using regression model.
• Different features are provided in the dataset. Which are
responsible for changing the pressure in the ventilator.
• These variable are used for predicting the pressure in the
ventilator.
• Different machine learning regression approaches are applied to
predict the pressure in the ventilator.
• These different model are then compared to obtain best model
which has higher performance than all others.
